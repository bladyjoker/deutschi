### Syllables

Seems like to express rules of verb conjugations (verb changes in the context of tense/mood/aspect) one would need to use the syllable factors of the verb.

### Datasets

- CEDEX2 <https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC96L14> (need an organization to access)

> For each language, this data set contains detailed information on:
>
> - orthography (variations in spelling, hyphenation)
> - phonology (phonetic transcriptions, variations in pronunciation, syllable structure, primary stress)
> - morphology (derivational and compositional structure, inflectional paradigms)
> - syntax (word class, word class-specific subcategorizations, argument structures)
> - word frequency (summed word and lemma counts, based on recent and representative text corpora)

## Glossary

- <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthography>
> An **orthography** is a set of conventions for writing a language, including norms of spelling, hyphenation, capitalization, word breaks, emphasis, and punctuation.

- <http://www.phon.ox.ac.uk/jcoleman/PHONOLOGY1.htm>
> **Phonetics** deals with the production of speech sounds by humans, often without prior knowledge of the language being spoken. **Phonology** is about patterns of sounds, especially different patterns of sounds in different languages, or within each language, different patterns of sounds in different positions in words etc.

- <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoneme>
> In phonology and linguistics, a phoneme /ˈfoʊniːm/ is a unit of sound that distinguishes one word from another in a particular language.

- <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonetic_transcription>

> Phonetic transcription (also known as phonetic script or phonetic notation) is the visual representation of speech sounds (or phones) by means of symbols. The most common type of phonetic transcription uses a phonetic alphabet, such as the International Phonetic Alphabet. 

- <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grapheme>

> In linguistics, a grapheme is the smallest functional unit of a writing system.

- <http://australianlinguistics.com/speech-sounds/phonemic-vs-phonetic/>
> **Phonemic** and **phonetic** transcription both have their purposes.  The goal of a phonemic transcription is to record the ‘phonemes as mental categories’ that a speaker uses, rather than the actual spoken variants of those phonemes that are produced in the context of a particular word.
